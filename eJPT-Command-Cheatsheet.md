# Nmap
___
#### Ping Sweep
```sh
nmap -sn <CIDR Notation>        #Finding alive IP addresses in the subnet
```
You can also perform ping sweep using fping tool
```
fping -a -g 10.54.12.0/24 2>/dev/null
```

Now you need to find open ports on each alive IP, you can perform this using two methods
#### METHOD - 1
Perform aggressive scan on all ports which might do not required to be scanned. This could cost you time and give results which might not be useful.
```sh
nmap -p- -A -Pn -iL hosts.txt       # hosts.txt file contains the alive host addresses
```
#### METHOD - 2
This method first find the open ports and after this you can perform aggressive scan on particular port. This method do not probe all the available ports blindly and you can choose which port might be useful to you to scan.

```sh
nmap -p- -T4 -Pn -vv -iL hosts.txt      # This will give you all the open ports on hosts provided using hosts.txt file

nmap -p<ports> -A -Pn -vv <IP>      # This will only probe ports selected by you for particular IP
```


# Analyzing HTTP and HTTPS
___

#### HTTP
```sh
nc -v www.abc.com 80        # After pressing enter you are prompted to send some data

Type two lines given below and press enter two times to get http response
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.abc.com 
```
#### HTTPs
```sh
openssl s_client -connect hack.me 443       # Establish ssl connection
```
After establishing ssl connection you can proceed like nc prompt

# Checking Routes and Adding Manual Routes
___

#### Checking Routes
```
ip route    # Checking defined routes in linux
route       # Checking defined routes in linux
route print     # Checking defined routes in windows
```
#### Adding Manual Routes
```sh
ip route add <subnet> via <gateway or router address>
```
for example,
```sh
ip route add 192.168.222.0/24 via 10.172.24.1       # Here 10.172.24.1 is the address of the gateway for subnet 192.168.222.0/24
```


# Finding MAC Addresses
___

```
ipconfig /all       # windows
ifconfig        # *nix OSs
ip addr     # linux
```

# Checking ARP Cache
___


```
arp -a      # Windows
arp     # *nix OSs

```
# Checking for Listening Ports on a Host
___
```
netstat -ano        # Windows

```

# SQLmap
___

#### Checking for existence of SQL injection
```sh
sqlmap -u ‘http://example.com/view.php?id=1141’ -p id       # GET Method

sqlmap -u ‘http://example.com/view.php’ --data <POST String> -p <parameter>     # POST Method
```
If vulnerable parameter found then you can proceed with extraction of data from database
```sh
sqlmap -u ‘http://example.com/view.php?id=1141’ --dbs     # Getting database names
sqlmap -u ‘http://example.com/view.php?id=1141’ -D <DB_name> --tables   # Getting table names
sqlmap -u ‘http://example.com/view.php?id=1141’ -D <db_name> -T <tbl_name> --columns    # Getting columns
sqlmap -u ‘http://example.com/view.php?id=1141’ -D <DB_name> -T <tbl_name> -C <column_name_comma_separate> --dump # To dump whole table remove column specification from the command and use only --dump option
```
# John-The-Ripper
___
```sh

john --show crackme     # Check cracked password after completion of cracking session, where crackme is the password database file
john -wordlist=<wordlist> <file to crack>
